# BOSvsLA-Crime-2020-24
## Problem Statement and Background:
- In recent years, the impact of economic downturns and public health crises, particularly the COVID-19 pandemic, has become a critical concern for cities across the United States, raising urgent questions about their influence on urban safety and crime. In response to these challenges, our project focuses on analyzing the differential impacts of these factors on crime rates and types of crime in two major cities: Boston and Los Angeles, from 2020 to 2024. Given that crime patterns are influenced by various socio-economic factors, this project seeks to uncover the correlations between unemployment rates, geographical distribution, and crime trends. By examining these variables, we aim to identify how these cities have responded to the combined pressures of economic instability and health crises, ultimately providing insights that could inform future urban planning, public safety measures, and policy decisions. Therefore, our research is driven by two key questions: “How do economic downturns and public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, differentially impact crime rates and types of crime in Boston versus Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024, and how do these factors influence public safety?” and “What lessons can be learned from these differences to inform future economic and public health policy decisions?” To address these questions, we utilized comprehensive datasets covering crime-related information, unemployment rates, and geographical maps from both cities. Our analysis not only explores the relationship between economic factors and crime rates but also delves into the spatial distribution of crimes within these urban areas. By understanding these patterns, stakeholders can better strategize interventions aimed at reducing crime and enhancing public safety in the face of future challenges.

## Introduction Data:
- 2020-2024 Boston Crime Data and Los Angeles Data are collected from government websites of each state and contain detailed information about crime incidents, including the type of crime, location, and time of occurrence. All the privacies of data are anonymized. The data spans from 2020 to 2024 and is used to analyze trends in crime rates and types over this period. The data may not capture all crime incidents due to underreporting or reporting delays. Changes in police reporting practices, data collection methods, or crime classification could introduce inconsistencies. All the privacies of data are anonymized. The dataset of unemployment provides monthly unemployment rates for the metropolitan area which are Boston and Los Angeles. It covers the economic impact of events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and graphic groups.

## Data Science Approaches:
- The data science approaches employed in this project involved a combination of data preparation, exploratory analysis, geospatial visualization, and statistical modeling methods. These approaches collectively enabled the identification of patterns, trends, and correlations in the datasets, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of crime rates, types, and distribution across Boston and Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024. First, our data preparation and exploration involved critical steps such as data cleaning, preprocessing, and the integration of multiple datasets, including crime-related data, unemployment rates, and geographic information. We employed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, including visual data exploration using box plots, line plots, and bar charts, to summarize the main characteristics of the data and identify initial patterns and trends. Data transformation techniques, such as date conversion and categorical mapping, were applied to streamline the data for more effective analysis. Next, we incorporated geospatial visualization to enhance our understanding of crime distribution in both cities. Heatmaps were generated for Boston and Los Angeles, illustrating crime hotspots and coldspots across different neighborhoods. To provide a clearer context and interpretation of the spatial patterns, we added city maps as an underlay to these heatmaps. This addition allowed for a more accurate and intuitive understanding of the regions affected by varying levels of criminal activity. Finally, statistical analysis and modeling were conducted to delve deeper into the relationships between socio-economic factors and crime rates. Trend analysis was performed to observe the fluctuations in crime rates over time, while regression analysis, including linear regression, was utilized to explore the impact of unemployment rates on crime trends. Comparative studies were carried out between the two cities, enabling us to uncover key differences and similarities in how unemployment rate and public health crises affected crime. These analyses, supported by statistical visualizations like box plots and scatter plots, provided a robust framework for understanding the complexities of crime patterns in urban areas during challenging times.

## Conclusion:
- The outbreak caused a sharp increase in unemployment in Boston and Los Angeles, followed by a gradual recovery. However, crime rates in the two cities responded differently, with more stable and seasonal crime patterns in Boston and greater volatility in Los Angeles. This project found that unemployment and crime rates are inversely correlated, challenging the expectation
that rising unemployment leads to higher crime rates. This suggests that other factors, such as social support, community engagement, and policing, may play an important role in mitigating crime during economically difficult times. It also shows that unemployment is only one of many factors that influence crime rates. Geographic and public safety analyses show that crime in Boston is more evenly distributed throughout the city, while crime in Los Angeles tends to be concentrated in specific hot spots. This insight highlights the need for localized public safety measures, especially in high-risk areas in Los Angeles. Overall, the project highlights the complex interactions between socioeconomic factors and crime, showing that crime trends cannot be attributed solely to economic conditions. The findings suggest that effective crime prevention strategies must consider multiple factors, including seasonality, geographic distribution, and the broader
social context. These insights will be valuable to policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and community organizations aiming to reduce crime and enhance public safety in urban settings.

## Future Work:
- For future work, we want to introduce a Crime Severity Index (CSI) that quantifies the seriousness of different crimes. This index could weigh crimes based on factors such as violence, financial impact, and social harm. Therefore, we can classify crimes into categories based on their severity. This classification will allow us to analyze whether economic downturns and public health crises differentially impact these categories. Moreover, we also can compare the findings from Boston and Los Angeles with other major cities to identify broader trends or unique local
factors influencing crime during economic downturns and public health crises in the future. Furthermore, we also need to explore more additional socio-economic variables, such as housing prices, education levels, or healthcare accessibility to see how these factors correlate with crime rates during the specified period and we can use multiple linear regression to do that.
